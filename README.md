## Robocode

I designed and developed AI using a behavior tree structure for the "SalmonBot" Robocode bot to compete with other robots as part of a group project.

The robot includes a commmunication protocol allowing for it to communicate with other robots on the same team and exhibit unique behavior while a Robocode game is active.
